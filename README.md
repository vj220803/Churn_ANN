# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning  

This project is a **Deep Learning-based Customer Churn Prediction System** built with **Keras (TensorFlow)** and deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application**.  

It predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the company) based on their profile and banking information.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
- **Problem Statement**: Customer churn is a major challenge for businesses. Identifying customers who are likely to leave allows proactive retention strategies.  
- **Approach**:
  - Preprocessed dataset (feature encoding, scaling).  
  - Built a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** using Keras/TensorFlow.  
  - Trained & evaluated the model on churn dataset.  
  - Saved trained model (`churn_model.h5`) and scaler (`scaler.pkl`).  
  - Developed an interactive **Streamlit app** for real-time prediction.  
- **Deployment**: The app is deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**, so no local installation of TensorFlow is required.
